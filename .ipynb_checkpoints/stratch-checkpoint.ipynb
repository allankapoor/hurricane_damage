    "# Post-Hurricane Structure Damage Assessment Leveraging Aerial Imagery and Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an effort to automate structure damage assessments based on post-hurricane aerial imagery. A labelled training dataset of images of structures from the Houston area just after Hurricane Harvey was acquired from the University of Washington Disaster Data Science Lab. Several neural network architectures were trained and evaluated, from basic architectures to transfer learning models with pretrained weights. Models were trained on Google Public Cloud virtual machines leveraging multiple GPUs to enable fast and efficient iteration. **The final model achieves an accuracy of 0.9775 on test data**. This model could be used by local, state, and federal natural disaster responders to quickly develop damage assessment maps based on a single fly-over by imaging aircraft after a hurricane.</p>\n",

    "<h2>Why Post-Hurricane Damage Assessment?</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural disasters, especially hurricanes and extreme storms, cause widespread destruction and loss of life and cost the U.S billions of dollars each year. Effective response after a natural disaster strikes is critical to reducing harm and facilitating long term recovery but manual damage assessments are time and resource intensive. A model that can perform automated damage assessment based on remote sensing imagery quickly captured by a few planes flying over a disaster site would greatly reduce the effort and increase speed in which useful data (location and extent of damaged structures) could be put in the hands of responders.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "The following sections summarize key steps in my process. Check out the Jupyter notebooks to see how it was done!</p>\n",

    "For code/more detail, see: [EDA Notebook](https://github.com/allankapoor/hurricane_damage/blob/master/Step1_EDA.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> Data Source </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for this project was sourced from a [labeled training dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/detecting-damaged-buildings-post-hurricane-satellite-imagery-based-customized) made publicly available by Quoc Dung Cao and Youngjun Choe at the University of Washington’s Disaster Data Science Lab. The dataset consists of images of structures cropped from aerial imagery collected in the days after Hurricane Harvey in Houston and other nearby cities. There are 12,000 images total: 8,000 for training, 2,000 for validation, and 2,000 for testing. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> Visual Inspection </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The images are color, in RGB format. The figure below compares 3 randomly selected damage images to 3 randomly selected no damage images. From viewing these examples along with others, some patterns emerged:</p>\n",
    "* Many (but not all) images have flood waters surrounding the structures, so there is a difference in ground texture/color.\n",
    " * Other damage images have small objects strewn across the ground. However, many images of no damage also display this visual pattern.\n",
    " * Images of structures with no damage seem more likely to feature visible ground  or pools with blue-ish water (uncovered by flood waters).\n",
    " * In many cases it isn't obvious to the human eye if an image shows damage or no damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example_images](https://github.com/allankapoor/hurricane_damage/blob/master/readme_images/examples.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> Summary Images </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification problems based on structured (tabular) data, it is common to explore summary statistics for each feature (column). For this image classification problem I used the numeric RGB color values in the images to calculate summary statistics by pixel (feature) and then plot them visually. By plotting visual summaries of the two classes differences can be identified between them that could inform decisions about neural network architecture.  </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Mean Value by Class </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "The figures below depict each pixel’s mean value across all images by class. For both damage and no damage images we see that a structure tends to be located within the center of the image. For damage images, the pixel values around the structure tend to be lower in value than around the no damage images. Perhaps this is because damage images tend to have flood waters around the structures, which are a different color than unflooded ground. </p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<h4>Standard Deviation by Class </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "The figures below are similar to those above but instead of depicting the mean pixel value they depict the standard deviation for each pixel by class. Standard deviation around the edges of the image appears to be (slightly) greater for the no damage images. Perhaps this is because visible ground around the structures creates more variation between images in that class. </p>\n",

    "<h3> Geographic Distribution </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "I investigated the geographic distribution of the training data by class. This is possible because the GPS coordinates are contained in the filename for each image file. The figure below depicts the locations of each image in the training dataset and whether it is damaged or not damaged. </p>\n",

    " \n",
    "We can see that the training data appears to come from 3 distinct areas. In one area, all structures in the training dataset are damaged, while in the other two there is a mix. Within those two there are clear spatial patterns of where flooding/damage occurred and where it didn't. </p>\n",

    "<h3>Baseline Model</h3>\n",
    "I first created a simple baseline model with three convolution layers, three dense layers, and an output layer with 2 nodes (corresponding to the two classes). Some initial modeling decisions were made here and carry through to the other models:  </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ReLU activation function is used for all layers except the final output layer because it is computationally efficient and known to lead good results in most cases\n",
    "* Batch normalization was included after the convolution layers but before activation based on experimentation (when batch normalization came after activation, validation accuracy dropped substantially). \n",
    "* Adam optimizer was used for updating network weights because it is known to perform well on image classification problems. Adam adjusts the learning rate over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline model trained on data with no image augmentation achieved a validation accuracy of 0.94650. When the pipeline was updated to include image augmentation, validation accuracy increased to 0.95650. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Model Improvement and Refinement</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Reducing Overfitting</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "During training of the baseline model, training validation scores regularly exceeded 0.99, while the validation accuracy was substantially lower. This suggested that the model was overfitting, even with variation in training data introduced by the image augmentation. To address this, I added:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Max pooling layers** downsample the outputs of the convolution layers by sliding a filter of the outputs and calculating the maximum pixel value within each window. This reduces the sensitivity of the model to exactly where features are located in an input image. Max pooling layers were added before the activation functions as this reduces the number of features that the activation function has to work on, increasing computational efficiency. \n",
    "* **Dropout layers** have the effect of making the training process noisy, forcing nodes within a layer to probabilistically take on more or less responsibility for the inputs - reducing the chances that the model will overfit to noise in the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Improving Convergence</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "While most of the models performed relatively well, a recurring issue was that models would achieve high accuracy after only a few training epochs but never converge. The figure below summarizes training and validation accuracy by epoch for a model that demonstrates this trend: </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "![no_converge](https://github.com/allankapoor/hurricane_damage/blob/master/readme_images/no_converge.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Model convergence was ultimately improved by a combination of several updates to the model architecture:</p>\n",
    " * Reduction in kernel size and stride for the first convolution layer\n",
    " * Reduction in number of filters in first convolution layer\n",
    " * Reduction in number of nodes in each dense layer by 50%\n",
    " * Reduction in initial learning rate for the Adam optimizer from the default (0.001) to 0.0001\n",
    " \n",
    "As summarized in the figure below, the updated model converges much better than before:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "![converge](https://github.com/allankapoor/hurricane_damage/blob/master/readme_images/converge.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Model Architecture</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Several combinations of hyperparameters were tested including smaller and larger convolution filters and more or less nodes in the dense layers. The model below achieved a **validation accuracy of 0.9735**, a substantial improvement over the baseline model. </p>\n",
